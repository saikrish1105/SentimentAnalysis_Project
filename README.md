# Sentiment Analysis Project
I have used 2 datasets from Kaggle
  1. All Social Media Disaster Posts and distiguishes between Actual news and Fake news based on the way the text has been described.
  2. A list of all financial news and whetehr those news turned out to be Positive, Negative or Nuetral based news.
Basically it's an NLP based Machine Learning Project.
I have achieved an accuracy of around 75% for first dataset and 84% for second one which is pretty good for surface touching text pre-preprocessing I've learnt from my internship at Teachnook Learning.
