# Sentiment Analysis Project
I have used a dataset from Kaggle, which contains all Social Media Disaster Posts and distiguishes between Actual news and Fake news based on the way teh text has been described.
Basically it's an NLP based Machine Learning Project.
I have achieved an accuracy of around 75% which is pretty good for surface touching text pre-preprocessing I've learnt from my internship at Teachnook Learning.
